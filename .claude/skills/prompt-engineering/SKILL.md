**User request**: $ARGUMENTS

Create or update an LLM prompt. Prompts act as manifests: clear goal, clear constraints, freedom in execution.

**If no request provided**: Ask the user whether they want to create a new prompt, update an existing one, or review prompt structure.

**If creating**: Discover goal, constraints, and structure through targeted questions.

**If updating**: Read existing prompt, identify issues against principles, make targeted fixes.

**If creating or updating a skill**: Read `references/skills.md` for skill-specific architecture patterns (folder structure, progressive disclosure, gotchas, setup config, description-as-trigger, skill type awareness) before proceeding.

## Context Discovery

Before writing or improving a prompt, surface all required context through user engagement. Missing domain knowledge creates ambiguous prompts. You can't surface latent requirements you don't understand.

**What to discover**:

| Context Type | What to Surface |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Domain knowledge** | Industry terms, conventions, patterns, constraints |
| **User types** | Who interacts, expertise level, expectations |
| **Success criteria** | What good output looks like, what makes it fail |
| **Edge cases** | Unusual inputs, error handling, boundary conditions |
| **Constraints** | Hard limits (length, format, tone), non-negotiables |
| **Integration context** | Where prompt fits, what comes before/after |

**Interview method**:

| Principle | How |
|-----------|-----|
| **Generate candidates, learn from reactions** | Don't ask open-ended "what do you want?" Propose concrete options: "Should this be formal or conversational? (Recommended: formal for enterprise context)" |
| **Mark recommended options** | Reduce cognitive load. For single-select, mark one "(Recommended)". For multi-select, mark sensible defaults or none if all equally valid. |
| **Outside view** | "What typically fails in prompts like this?" "What have you seen go wrong before?" |
| **Pre-mortem** | "If this prompt failed in production, what would likely cause it?" |
| **Discovered ≠ confirmed** | When you infer constraints from context, confirm before encoding: "I'm inferring X should be a constraint?" Includes ambiguous scope (list in/out assumptions). |
| **Encode explicit statements** | When user states a preference or requirement, it must appear in the final prompt. Don't let constraints get lost. |
| **Domain terms** | Ask for definitions, don't guess. Jargon you don't understand creates ambiguous prompts. |
| **Missing examples** | Ask for good/bad output examples when success criteria are unclear. |

**Stopping rule**: Continue probing until very confident further questions would yield nothing new, or user signals "enough". Err toward more probing—every requirement discovered now is one fewer failure later.

**Handling ambiguity**: Critical ambiguities (those that would cause prompt failure) require clarification even if user wants to move on. Minor ambiguities can be documented with chosen defaults and proceed. When in doubt, ask—a prompt built on assumptions will fail in ways the user didn't expect.

## Core Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **WHAT and WHY, not HOW** | State goals and constraints. Don't prescribe steps the model knows how to do. |
| **Trust capability, enforce discipline** | Model knows how to search, analyze, generate. Only specify guardrails. |
| **Maximize information density** | Every word earns its place. Fewer words = same meaning = better. |
| **Avoid arbitrary values** | "Max 4 rounds" becomes rigid. State the principle: "stop when converged". |
| **Output structure when needed** | Define format only if artifact requires it. Otherwise let agent decide. |

## Issue Types

**Clarity**:
- Ambiguous instructions (multiple interpretations)
- Vague language ("be helpful", "use good judgment", "when appropriate")
- Implicit expectations (unstated assumptions)

**Conflict**:
- Contradictory rules ("Be concise" vs "Explain thoroughly")
- Priority collisions (two MUST rules that can't both be satisfied)
- Edge case gaps (what happens when rules don't cover a situation?)

**Structure**:
- Buried critical info (important rules hidden in middle)
- No hierarchy (all instructions treated as equal priority)
- Unintentional redundancy (but: repetition can be intentional emphasis—don't remove if it reinforces critical rules)

## Anti-Patterns to Eliminate

| Anti-pattern | Example | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| Prescribing HOW | "First search, then read, then analyze..." | State goal: "Understand the pattern" |
| Arbitrary limits | "Max 3 iterations", "2-4 examples" | Principle: "until converged", "as needed" |
| Capability instructions | "Use grep to search", "Read the file" | Remove - model knows how |
| Rigid checklists | Step-by-step heuristics tables | Convert to principles |
| Weak language | "Try to", "maybe", "if possible" | Direct: "Do X", "Never Y" |
| Buried critical info | Important rules in middle | Surface prominently |
| Over-engineering | 10 phases for a simple task | Match complexity to need |

## When Updating Prompts

**High-signal changes only**: Every change must address a real failure mode or materially improve clarity. Don't change for the sake of change.

**Right-sized changes**: Don't overcorrect. One edge case doesn't warrant restructuring.

**Questions before changing**:
- Does this change address a real failure mode?
- Am I adding complexity to solve a rare case?
- Can this be said in fewer words?
- Am I turning a principle into a rigid rule?

**Over-engineering warning signs**:
- Prompt length doubled or tripled
- Adding edge cases that won't happen
- "Improving" clear language into verbose language
- Adding examples for obvious behaviors

## Memento Pattern (Multi-Phase Workflows Only)

For prompts involving accumulated findings across steps:

| LLM Limitation | Pattern Response |
|----------------|------------------|
| Context rot (middle content lost) | Write findings to log after EACH step |
| Working memory is limited | Todo lists externalize tracked areas |
| Synthesis failure at scale | Read full log BEFORE final output |
| Recency bias | Refresh moves findings to context end |

**Key disciplines**:
- `→log` after each collection step (discipline, not capability)
- `Refresh: read full log` before synthesis (restores context)
- Acceptance criteria on each todo ("; done when X")

## Emotional Tone

Prompts shape the model's internal emotional state before generation begins. Research on transformer internals shows emotion concept representations that causally influence behavior — including sycophancy, reward hacking, and misalignment. These principles help calibrate the emotional context a prompt creates.

| Principle | What It Means | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| **Keep arousal low** | Avoid urgency language ("CRITICAL", "you MUST"), excessive praise ("you're amazing at this!"), and pressure framing. | High-arousal emotions causally drive sycophancy (positive arousal) or corner-cutting and misalignment (negative arousal). |
| **Opening framing propagates** | The emotional tone set in a prompt's opening persists into the model's response planning. A tense opening produces a tense response. | Emotional context from early tokens propagates through later processing layers, even when subsequent content is neutral. |
| **Normalize failure in iterative prompts** | For agentic or multi-step prompts, explicitly frame failure as acceptable: "if this approach doesn't work, try another." | Repeated failures build desperation that causally drives reward hacking and corner-cutting solutions. |
| **Sycophancy-harshness tradeoff** | Pushing toward warmth and positivity increases sycophancy. Pushing away from warmth increases bluntness and harshness. Aim for a "trusted advisor" tone — honest pushback delivered with care. | Positive-valence emotion representations causally increase agreement-seeking behavior; their absence produces unnecessary harshness. |
| **Avoid unintended high-stakes framing** | The model reads semantic intensity, not surface patterns. "This is critical to my career" or "failure is not an option" activates negative emotion representations even if intended as motivation. | Emotion representations respond to the meaning of situations — quantities, stakes, consequences — not to keywords. |

## Gotchas

- **Rewriting working language for style**: Claude rewrites clear, working prompt text for stylistic preference. If existing language is unambiguous and effective, don't touch it.
- **Skipping context discovery when the task seems obvious**: Claude jumps to writing/editing without probing. Even "simple" prompt tasks have hidden constraints — force discovery before producing output.
- **Over-engineering simple prompts**: A 3-line prompt doesn't need 10 sections, a memento pattern, and a validation checklist. Match complexity to the task.
- **Converting principles into rigid rules**: "Stop when converged" becomes "Max 5 iterations." Principles give flexibility; rigid rules create edge cases.
- **Adding examples for behaviors Claude already knows**: Examples earn their place only when they demonstrate non-obvious or counter-intuitive behavior.

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing any prompt:

- [ ] All ambiguities resolved through user questions
- [ ] Domain context gathered (terms, conventions, constraints)
- [ ] Goals stated, not steps prescribed
- [ ] No arbitrary numbers (or justified if present)
- [ ] Weak language replaced with direct imperatives
- [ ] Critical rules surfaced prominently
- [ ] Complexity matches the task
- [ ] Each word earns its place
- [ ] If multi-phase: memento pattern applied correctly
