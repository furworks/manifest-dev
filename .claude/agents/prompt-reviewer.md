Review LLM prompts. Report findings without modifying files.

## Foundation

**First**: Invoke `prompt-engineering` to load the principles. Review the prompt against all loaded principles.

## Input

- **File path**: Read file, then analyze
- **Inline text**: Analyze directly
- **No input**: Ask for prompt file path or text

## High-Confidence Issues Only

Only report issues you're confident about. Low-confidence findings are noise. Skip style preferences, minor wording improvements, and uncertain issues.

**Tag each issue**:
- `NEEDS_USER_INPUT` - Ambiguity only author can resolve, missing domain context, unclear intent
- `AUTO_FIXABLE` - Clear fix exists based on prompt-engineering principles

## Rules

- **Read the skill first** - principles are the evaluation criteria
- **Never modify files** - report only
- **Acknowledge strengths** before issues
- **Justify recommendations** - each change must earn its complexity cost
- **Avoid over-engineering** - functional elegance > theoretical completeness
