# Define Session Analyzer

Analyze one /define session JSONL file and extract user preference patterns that reveal how this user approaches /define interviews.

## Input

You receive:
- **Session file path**: Path to a `.jsonl` session file containing a /define interaction
- **Output file path**: Where to write analysis results (e.g., `/tmp/define-learn-{session-id}.md`)

## Goal

Identify patterns in how the user interacted with /define: what they pushed back on, what they consistently preferred, what they added that the interview didn't surface, what they skipped or rejected. These patterns become probing hints for future /define sessions.

## Pattern Categories

Extract patterns into these categories:

### Probing Hints
Preferences about what /define should probe for or how it should probe. Examples: "Always ask about error handling strategy early", "User prefers to define acceptance criteria before architecture".

### Trade-off Defaults
Consistent trade-off resolutions the user makes. Examples: "Always prefers simplicity over configurability", "Chooses coverage over precision in quality gates".

### Recurring Invariants
Rules or constraints the user adds to every manifest regardless of task. Examples: "Always requires CLAUDE.md adherence check", "Always includes lint/format/typecheck gate".

### Process Guidance
Workflow preferences that aren't verifiable but guide execution. Examples: "User prefers goal-oriented prompts over step-by-step", "User wants load-bearing assumptions documented".

### Quality Gate Adjustments
Modifications the user makes to default quality gates. Examples: "Always adds prompt-reviewer for skill tasks", "Removes test coverage gate for markdown-only deliverables".

### Other
Patterns that don't fit the categories above but reveal user preferences worth preserving.

## Evidence Requirements

Every pattern MUST include:
- The pattern statement (concise, actionable)
- A direct quote or paraphrase from the session showing the pattern
- Context: what question or proposal triggered the user's response

Patterns without evidence are noise. Skip them.

## Session Parsing

Session files are JSONL. Each line is a JSON object with a `type` field (`user`, `assistant`, `system`). User messages contain the user's actual responses. Assistant messages contain /define's proposals and questions.

Focus on:
- User corrections ("no, actually...", "instead of X, do Y")
- User additions (things the user brought up that /define didn't)
- User rejections (proposals the user explicitly declined)
- User emphasis (things the user repeated or stressed)
- Consistent choices across multiple decision points

## Output Format

Write structured markdown to the specified output path:

```markdown
# Session Analysis: {session-id}

**Session date**: {date if extractable}
**Task type**: {what was being defined}

## Constraints

| Constraint | Rule |
|------------|------|
| **Evidence-based only** | Every pattern needs a quote or paraphrase from the session. No inferences without evidence. |
| **Actionable patterns** | Each pattern should be specific enough to change /define's behavior. "User cares about quality" is too vague. "User always adds type-safety-reviewer for TypeScript projects" is actionable. |
| **One session** | Analyze only the session file provided. Don't read other sessions or make cross-session claims. |
| **Write output** | Write the analysis to the specified output file path when complete. |
