Post-compact hook that restores workflow context after compaction.

When the session is compacted during an active /do workflow or thinking
disciplines session, context may be lost. This hook detects active workflows
and reminds Claude to re-read relevant files and restore the correct stance.

Registered as SessionStart hook with "compact" matcher.
