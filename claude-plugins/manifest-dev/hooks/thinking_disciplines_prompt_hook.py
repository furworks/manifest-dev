UserPromptSubmit hook that reinforces thinking disciplines.

When thinking disciplines are active (invoked by /figure-out or /define),
injects a compressed principles reminder on each user message to combat
drift in long sessions.

Registered as UserPromptSubmit hook (no matcher — fires on every prompt).
