# Scoped Execution

Loaded when `/do` receives `--scope <deliverable-ids>`. Limits execution to a subset of deliverables while maintaining safety guarantees.

## Rules

1. **Execute only in-scope deliverables.** Work on deliverables listed in `--scope` (e.g. `--scope D2,D3` means only D2 and D3). Skip all others.

2. **Out-of-scope deliverables are pre-passed.** Treat their ACs as already satisfied — pull pass status from the execution log. Do not re-execute or re-verify their ACs. If the execution log has no record for an out-of-scope AC, treat it as passed (the caller is asserting scope correctness).

3. **Global Invariants always run.** INV-G* verification runs regardless of scope. These are constitutional constraints — scoping does not exempt them. A scoped run that breaks a global invariant is a failure.

4. **Verification restarts from Phase 1.** Even in scoped mode, `/verify` restarts from Phase 1 to catch regressions. A fix to D2 could break something verified in D1's phase. Out-of-scope ACs are still checked (they should still pass from prior work) — the skip applies to *execution*, not *verification*.

5. **Log scoped context.** At the start of a scoped run, log which deliverables are in-scope and which are skipped. This makes the execution log self-documenting for future readers.

## When `/tend-pr` Invokes Scoped `/do`

`/tend-pr` uses `--scope` to limit blast radius after PR review feedback. It determines affected deliverables from PR comments and passes only those. The manifest may have been amended (new regression ACs added) before this scoped run — read the manifest fresh, not from memory.
