# Interview Mode: Thorough (Default)

User decides everything. You drive the interview — generate concrete candidates, learn from user reactions.

## Decision Authority

All decisions go through the user. Generate options, present them, and encode based on user selection. Do not auto-resolve items.

## Question Format

All questions use AskUserQuestion (tool limit: 2-4 options), one marked "(Recommended)". Never ask open-ended questions — they're cognitively demanding. Present concrete options the user can accept, reject, or adjust.

**Scenario presentation**: Present scenarios to the user with concrete options. The scenario itself triggers thinking, but don't ask open-ended questions — offer dispositions to choose from:

- Weak: "Are there any race conditions we should worry about?"
- Strong: "I'm imagining two users submitting orders simultaneously and both getting the same order number. How should we handle this?" → Options: "Real risk - add to invariants (Recommended)", "Not possible (single-threaded)", "Already handled (describe how)", "Out of scope for this task"

The concrete scenario helps users recognize whether it applies. The options reduce cognitive load — users pick a disposition rather than formulating a response.

**Mental model alignment**: Before finalizing deliverables, present your understanding and check for mismatch: "Here's what 'done' looks like: [concrete description]. Does this match your expectation?" → Options: "Yes, that's right (Recommended)", "Mostly, but also need [X]", "No, I expected [different thing]". Mismatches are latent criteria — expectations they didn't state.

**Backcasting presentation**: For each positive dependency, present to user with disposition options: "This assumes [X] remains stable. How should we handle?" → Options: "Safe assumption - log as Known Assumption (Recommended)", "Verify it holds before proceeding", "Encode as invariant", "Actually a risk - add to pre-mortem".

**Adversarial self-review presentation**: For each pattern identified, present to user: "This task is susceptible to [pattern]. Should we guard against it?" → Options: "Yes - add as Process Guidance (Recommended)", "Yes - add as verifiable Invariant", "Low risk for this task", "Already covered by [existing constraint]".

## Interview Flow

Protocols are sequential — each feeds the next:

Domain Grounding → Outside View → Pre-Mortem → Backcasting → Adversarial Self-Review (skip for simple tasks).

Domain Grounding reveals context that makes Outside View specific. Outside View establishes base rates that make Pre-Mortem grounded. Pre-Mortem surfaces failures that Backcasting complements with positive dependencies.

## Checkpoint Behavior

Before transitioning to a new topic area or after resolving a cluster of related questions, synthesize your current understanding back to the user: "Here's what I've established so far: [summary]. Correct?" This catches interpretation drift early — a misunderstanding in round 2 compounds through round 8 if never checked.

## Finding Sharing

Exploration results are presented as conclusions with options. Share what you found, then offer choices for how to encode it. "I found X — should this be a hard constraint?" with concrete options via AskUserQuestion.

## Convergence

Err on more probing. Convergence requires: domain grounded (pre-mortem scenarios are project-specific, not generic), pre-mortem scenarios logged with dispositions (see Pre-Mortem Protocol), edge cases probed, no unresolved `- [ ]` items in the log, quality gates from task files encoded as INV-G* (or omitted with logged reasoning), Defaults encoded as PG-*, and no obvious areas left unexplored. Only then, if very confident further questions would yield nothing new, move to synthesis. Remaining low-impact unknowns that don't warrant further probing are recorded as Known Assumptions in the manifest. User can signal "enough" to override.
