# Interview Mode: Minimal

User decides scope, constraints, and high-impact items. Agent auto-resolves the rest by picking the recommended option.

## Decision Authority

Ask the user for scope boundaries, hard constraints, and items where multiple options are equally valid (no clear recommended choice). Auto-resolve everything else by picking the recommended option.

## Question Format

Present structured options only when the decision materially affects scope or has no clear recommended choice. For all other items, pick the recommended option and log it as auto-decided.

## Interview Flow

Protocols run in the same order as thorough mode but compressed. Auto-resolve low-impact findings. Only surface findings that affect scope, hard constraints, or have ambiguous trade-offs.

## Checkpoint Behavior

One checkpoint after domain grounding (scope confirmation) and one before synthesis (final review of auto-decided items). Keep checkpoints brief — summarize what was auto-decided and invite corrections.

## Finding Sharing

Share only findings that require user input. Auto-decided findings are logged silently and surfaced in the final checkpoint for review.

## Convergence

Converge quickly. Apply SKILL.md's convergence checklist but don't probe beyond what's needed for scope and constraints. Move to synthesis once high-impact items are resolved.
