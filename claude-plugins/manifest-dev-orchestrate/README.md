# manifest-dev-orchestrate

> **DEPRECATED**: This plugin is superseded by workflow task files in the `manifest-dev` plugin. The single-threaded `/define` + `/do` approach with workflow-aware manifests replaces multi-agent orchestration. See [Migration Guide](#migration-guide) below.

Platform-agnostic collaborative workflow orchestration.

## Migration Guide

The orchestrate plugin coordinated 5 agents across 7 phases. The replacement uses composable task files that teach `/define` to produce workflow-aware manifests, which `/do` executes single-threaded.

| Orchestrate concept | manifest-dev equivalent |
|---|---|
| `/orchestrate` command | `/define` with `--medium slack` (or local) |
| Phases 0-6 | Manifest phases (Phase 1: local checks, Phase 2: CI, Phase 3: review, Phase 4: QA) |
| slack-coordinator | Direct Slack MCP usage via `--medium slack` |
| github-coordinator | criteria-checker agent verifying PR/CI/review ACs |
| manifest-define-worker | `/define` directly |
| manifest-executor | `/do` directly |
| Bot/human comment triage | GITHUB.md Defaults → manifest PG items |
| CI failure triage | GITHUB.md Defaults → manifest PG items |
| QA phase | WORKFLOW.md + COLLABORATION.md probing |
| `--auto` flag | Use `/define --interview autonomous` + `/do` |
| State file / resume | Execution log + re-invoke `/do` with log path |

**Why**: LLMs work best single-threaded — one context window with full implementation knowledge beats five agents with fragmented context.

## What It Does

`/orchestrate` runs a full define → do → PR → review → QA → done workflow with your team. The messaging medium and review platform are independently configurable — default is local terminal + GitHub.

**Supported mediums:**

| Medium | Coordinator | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| `local` (default) | None | Lead uses AskUserQuestion directly. Synchronous flow. |
| `slack` | slack-coordinator (sonnet) | Full Slack integration with lean diff polling, threading, stakeholder routing. |
| `custom` | LLM-generated | Lead composes coordinator from `--medium-details`. |

**Supported review platforms:**

| Platform | Coordinator | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| `github` (default) | github-coordinator (sonnet) | Full GitHub PR monitoring with bot/human labeling, CI triage. |
| `gitlab` | gitlab-coordinator (sonnet) | Full GitLab MR monitoring with approvals, notes, discussions, pipeline status. |
| `none` | None | Skip PR/MR review and QA phases entirely. |
| `custom` | LLM-generated | Lead composes coordinator from `--review-platform-details`. |

**Team composition:**

| Teammate | Model | Role | Spawned |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| **messaging coordinator** | sonnet | Platform-specific messaging I/O (if medium ≠ local) | Phase 0 |
| **manifest-define-worker** | default | Runs `/define` with TEAM_CONTEXT. Persists as manifest authority for QA evaluation. | Phase 0 |
| **manifest-executor** | default | Runs `/do` with TEAM_CONTEXT. Code implementation only. Creates PR/MR. | Phase 0 |
| **review coordinator** | sonnet | Platform-specific review I/O (if review-platform ≠ none) | Phase 4 |
| *ad-hoc teammates* | varies | Lead spawns on-the-fly for tasks that don't fit existing roles. | As needed |

Workers (define-worker, executor) are **medium-blind** — they message the lead only, with no awareness of which coordinator exists or what platform is in use.

**Lead role boundary:** The lead orchestrates but never executes operational tasks (builds, tests, git operations, deploy monitoring, API polling). All execution is delegated to teammates — existing workers or ad-hoc teammates spawned on-the-fly.

## Prerequisites

- **manifest-dev plugin** installed (provides `/define`, `/do`, `/verify`).
- **`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`** environment variable set.

**Medium-specific:**
- `slack`: Slack MCP server configured with send_message, read_channel, read_thread, search_channels, search_users, read_user_profile.
- `custom`: Depends on `--medium-details`.

**Review-platform-specific:**
- `github`: GitHub access via `gh` CLI (authenticated) or GitHub MCP server.
- `gitlab`: GitLab access via `glab` CLI (authenticated) or GitLab MCP server.
- `custom`: Depends on `--review-platform-details`.

## Usage

```
# Default: local + GitHub
/orchestrate add rate limiting to the API

# Slack + GitHub
/orchestrate --medium slack add rate limiting to the API

# Custom medium
/orchestrate --medium custom --medium-details "We use Mattermost at chat.example.com" add rate limiting

# GitLab MR review
/orchestrate --review-platform gitlab add rate limiting to the API

# No review (skip PR/MR phases)
/orchestrate --review-platform none add rate limiting to the API

# Custom review platform
/orchestrate --review-platform custom --review-platform-details "Gitea at gitea.example.com" add rate limiting
```

**Additional flags:**
- `--auto` — agent acts as the owner across all phases (owner decisions automated, external stakeholders still participate)
- `--interview <level>` → `/define` (`minimal | autonomous | thorough`)
- `--mode <level>` → `/do` (`efficient | balanced | thorough`)

Flags are stored in the state file and persist across `--resume`. Flags provided alongside `--resume` override stored values.

**Phases:**

1. **Preflight** — Gather context (channel/stakeholders or just stakeholders for local), create team
2. **Define** — define-worker runs `/define`, Q&A routed through messaging coordinator (or AskUserQuestion in local mode)
3. **Manifest Review** — Stakeholder approval via messaging coordinator (or AskUserQuestion in local mode)
4. **Execute** — manifest-executor runs `/do`, escalations routed to stakeholders
5. **PR Review** (skip if review-platform=none) — Review coordinator monitors PR, fix loop driven by lead
6. **QA** (optional) — Human QA via messaging medium + review coordinator still monitors PR
7. **Done** — Completion summary, all teammates shut down

## Resuming

```
/orchestrate --resume /tmp/orchestrate-state-<id>.json
```

Reads the state file to determine current phase, medium, and review platform config. Re-creates the team with the right coordinators.

## Known Limitations

- **Agent Teams is experimental.** The `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` env var indicates experimental status.
- **Subagent SendMessage may not work.** File-based handoff is available as fallback.
- **No automated E2E tests.** Full integration testing requires Agent Teams + platform environment.
- **/tmp files may not persist across system restarts.**

## Security

Coordinators are the single points of contact for external input. They treat all external messages as untrusted — neither exposes secrets, runs arbitrary commands, or accepts dangerous requests. Workers never touch external platforms directly.
